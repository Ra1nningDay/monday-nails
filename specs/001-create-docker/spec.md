# Feature Specification: Dockerized Deployment with PostgreSQL

**Feature Branch**: `[001-can-u-create]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "can u create docker image and build that's include postgredb for this project?"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   - If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   - Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   - Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   - If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   - Each requirement must be testable
   - Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   - If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   - If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Quick Guidelines
- Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to run the project inside Docker (with a PostgreSQL database) so that I can set up consistent local and staging environments without manual provisioning.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer with Docker installed, **When** they run `docker compose up --build`, **Then** the Next.js app builds via pnpm, runs on port 3000, and is reachable at `http://localhost:3000`.
2. **Given** the compose stack is running, **When** the app reads `DATABASE_URL` from the environment, **Then** it connects to the bundled PostgreSQL container using the configured credentials.
3. **Given** the stack is stopped, **When** it is started again, **Then** PostgreSQL data persists via a Docker volume so previous records remain available.
4. **Given** onboarding documentation for contributors, **When** a new developer follows the Docker workflow, **Then** they can seed Prisma and run migrations inside the containers without leaving the Docker environment.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the Docker host already has services on ports 3000 or 5432?
- How does the stack handle missing or invalid environment variables required by Next.js or Postgres?
- What is the recovery process if the Postgres volume becomes corrupted or the password must be rotated?
- The Dockerfile will be production-grade and reused for staging/production images, while `docker-compose.yml` targets local/staging orchestration only.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Provide a multi-stage Dockerfile that installs dependencies with pnpm, builds the Next.js app, and runs it with production-ready settings.
- **FR-002**: Supply a Docker Compose configuration that orchestrates the Next.js container and a PostgreSQL container, wiring environment variables for `DATABASE_URL` and any required secrets.
- **FR-003**: The compose setup MUST expose application and database ports while allowing overrides to avoid host conflicts.
- **FR-004**: The stack MUST include migration and seeding steps (e.g., `pnpm prisma migrate deploy`) so that the database schema is initialized when containers start.
- **FR-005**: Documentation MUST explain how to build, run, stop, and clean the Docker stack, including instructions for managing Prisma migrations inside containers.
- **FR-006**: System MUST package PostgreSQL 16 with data stored in a named Docker volume that persists between restarts unless the user explicitly removes it.
- **FR-007**: Compose MUST define container healthchecks (no additional admin UI required) so automation can detect when the web and database services are ready.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Application Service**: Dockerized Next.js app built from repository source, exposing HTTP port 3000 (or configured alternative) and relying on env vars for Prisma, Vercel analytics, and other secrets.
- **Database Service**: PostgreSQL container (version to be confirmed) with persistent volume mapping and credentials stored in `.env.docker` or compose overrides.
- **Docker Compose Stack**: Declarative configuration tying services, networks, volumes, and lifecycle commands (`build`, `up`, `down`) for consistent environments.
